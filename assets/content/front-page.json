This will give both parties a better idea of what the site should look like. At this point we will also figure out your domain name and hosting options for the site. Next Eugene will create some basic mock-ups or \"wireframes\" to start desgining the site layout. Moving to a more detailed rendering, Eugene will share the basic structure of the site with his client.",

The amount of content affects the layout of each page and is really helpful to figure out early in the project. By the end of the design stage Eugene will provide you with a detailed digital rendering of your site design. With client approval, Eugene will move forward into the development stage, and start the coding of your site!",

During the sites development the design continues to improve as Eugene and his client see what the site looks. This is also when content needs to be finished delivered to Eugene.
